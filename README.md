## Why This Repository Matters

Many students and beginners often skip basic-level programs, thinking they're too easy or not worth practicing.

However, these fundamentals are **extremely important** — especially in coding interviews and real-world debugging.  
Most errors, misunderstandings, or poor logic stem from gaps in these “easy” concepts.

This repository aims to:
- Reinforce your core programming foundation
- Ensure no concept is taken for granted
- Help you grow from beginner → intermediate → pro

Even expert programmers revisit the basics — because **clarity at the core is power in the code.**
